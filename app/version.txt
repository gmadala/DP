NextGear Capital v1.1.0
=================================

Fixed in this release:

DTWO-2906 - Title State And Number
DTWO-2911 - Add an Input Mechanism for Specifying "I Have It"
VO-213 - Sort the upcoming payments By Due Date
VO-214 - Payment Search Filter List By Due Date
VO-215 - Sort Scheduled Payments Default View
VO-389 - EUI Web Site - viewing a receipt after payment is made takes you to the receipt screen and not the receipt
901 - mobile - color-code the # indicators for payment-related information on dashboard to match web site
1015 - Upcoming Payments --> Month View Footer --> Missing Redundant Controls 
1011 - Mobile - Payments Summary --> no easy way to get back to Payments Summary when no results returned
912 - Web: Forgot Username/Password - Layout Issue
1205 - Mobile - Break stale/aging units into 5 sections rather than 4, so that they match the desktop app.
1206 - Mobile - Make the entire list items in the multiple VIN and Seller Search lists clickable; right now only the '>' character is clickable, so it's harder for users to tap.
VO-467 - Logo on website - G is "weird"
