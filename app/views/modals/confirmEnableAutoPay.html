    <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
    <h4>Authorization and Request for Automated Payments</h4>
    The Authorization and Request for Automated Payments (this “Automated Payment Request”) may only be submitted by an
    authorized representative of the Borrower designated on the account that you are currently logged into (this
    “Account”). By submitting this Automated Payment Request, you are certifying to NextGear Capital, Inc. (“Lender”)
    that you are an authorized representative of Borrower and have all necessary authority to provide the authorizations
    and make the requests set forth herein, in each case for and on behalf of Borrower. Capitalized terms used herein
    but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings as set forth in that certain Demand Promissory Note and
    Loan and Security Agreement by and between Borrower and Lender (the “Note”).

    By clicking on the “Enroll” button at the bottom of this Automated Payment Request, Borrower hereby authorizes and
    requests Lender to initiate recurring electronic debit entries (each, an “Automated Debit”) from the bank account
    specified by Borrower in that certain ACH Authorization and Request or similar authorization, executed by Borrower
    in favor of Lender (as the same now exists or is hereafter amended, the “Designated Account”) in payment of amounts
    and other Liabilities owed by Borrower under the Note and the other Loan Documents. Lender will schedule an
    Automated Debit from the Designated Account on the Maturity Date for any Liability, in each case in such amount as
    is due and owing with respect to such Liability on or after the date that such Automated Payment is scheduled by
    Lender (including any applicable fees, interest and other amounts incurred by Borrower or accrued on such Liability
    after the Maturity Date) (collectively, an “Automated Payment”).


    Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that:

    This Automated Payment Request may take up to five (5) Business Days for Lender to process. Once this Automated
    Payment Request has been processed by Lender, a confirmation may be sent to Borrower via email to the email address
    designated for Borrower’s account (the “Designated Email”). . Once this Automated Payment Request is processed by
    Lender, the Automated Debits will continue to be initiated by Lender until such time as Borrower terminates this
    Automated Payment Request by logging into Borrower’s Account at https://customer.nextgearcapital.com and
    un-enrolling. Any termination of this Automated Payment Request by Borrower may take up to five (5) Business Days
    for Lender to process, and during this time Lender may continue to initiate Automated Debits in accordance with this
    Automated Payment Request.
    • Borrower must maintain sufficient funds in the Designated Account to satisfy all Automated Debits authorized under
    this Automated Payment Request. If the Designated Account holds insufficient funds to cover an Automated Debit,
    Borrower may be assessed fees or other charges by both the financial institution at which the Designated Account is
    held (the “Depository Bank”) and by Lender, just as if Borrower had written a check to Lender that was returned for
    insufficient funds.

    • Borrower is solely responsible for any overdraft charges or other fees that the Depository Bank may assess in
    connection with any Automated Debits initiated pursuant to this Automated Payment Request.

    • This Automated Payment Request shall be deemed a “Loan Document” for all intents and purposes under the Note, and
    Lender shall be entitled to avail itself of any limitations of liability and other similar protections or relief
    afforded Lender under the Note, and these provisions and protections shall apply to any Automated Debit or other
    transaction initiated by Lender hereunder. Additionally, Lender shall have no liability and shall not be responsible
    for any damages arising from or relating to any checks or other payments dishonored after the available balance in
    the Designated Account is reduced by any Automated Debit or other transaction initiated by Lender hereunder.

    • Borrower will remain liable and responsible for all amounts owed under the Note and other Loan Documents which
    remain unpaid as a result of an unsuccessful attempt to debit funds from the Designated Account pursuant to this
    Automated Payment Request.

    • This Automated Payment Request does not create a fiduciary relationship between Lender and Borrower.

    • Borrower is bound by the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA), as in
    effect from time to time with regard to each Automated Debit and other transaction initiated by Lender hereunder.

    • Lender may send to Borrower at its Designated Email a confirmation of each Automated Debit and other transaction
    processed hereunder. Borrower shall maintain the active status of the Designated Email (or provide immediate written
    notification to Lender of any change in the Designated Email) at all times.

    • In the event that any of Borrower’s Designated Account information changes, or in the event that Borrower closes
    the Designated Account, Borrower will update its Designated Account information at least ten (10) Business Days
    prior to the effective date of such change or closure by logging into Borrower’s Account at
    https://customer.nextgearcapital.com. .

    Lender may, if necessary, initiate adjustments at any time and without advance notice to Borrower for any Automated
    Debit made in error to the Designated Account pursuant to this Automated Payment Request. Lender reserves the right
    to terminate Borrower or this Automated Payment Request program at any time and without prior notice to Borrower.
    This Automated Payment Request does not in any way terminate, amend or modify, in whole or in part the Note or any
    other Loan Documents, including any ACH Authorization and Request or similar authorization or any other agreements
    between Borrower and Lender. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that this Automated Payment Request and the Automated
    Debits being authorized and requested herein are in addition to any ACH Authorization and Request or similar
    authorization or request that may have been submitted to Lender and any electronic debits or other payments
    authorized or requested by Borrower therein.
