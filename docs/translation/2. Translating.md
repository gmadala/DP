# Translating Strings

Translating the actual strings is done by a third party. We are tasked with generating the `.po` file for them to use when translating, and then converting that back into JS used in the application. Majority of this is handled automatically by __angular-gettext__.


## Translations

Since the actual translations are done by a third party, we do not need to worry about this. All you should know is the basics of how it works.

- We extract the strings from our code
- The extraction tasks generate a `.po` file which is a standard translation format
- The third party can use an application to open the file, translate each string, then save it for returning to us
- We take the updated translation file and convert it to JS array through our compilation tasks

If you would like to know more about how it works, you can view the [translating guide](http://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/translate/) on angular-gettext's website.



## Extracting Strings

__angular-gettext__ has a grunt module __grunt-angular-gettext__. If you do not have it on your system yet, a simple `npm install` will get it setup for you since it's included in our package file.

Strings are extracted from the HTML and JS by parsing it and looking for specific code. Here are the sample extraction methods:

__HTML__ uses the directive or filter:

__Directive:__  `<h1 translate>Hello!</h1>`<br>
__Filter:__ `<input placeholder="{{ 'Username' | translate }}" />`

__JS__ uses the javascript methods for extracting and getting:

__Get String:__ `var translated = gettextCatalog.getString("Hello");`<br>
__Get Plural:__ `var myString2 = gettextCatalog.getPlural(count, "Bird", "Birds");`

You can inject `gettextCatalog` into your angular code to use these methods.

### Running Extraction

You can run an extraction through the grunt task:

`grunt nggettext_extract`

Or if you use our custom task `grunt translate`, it will run extract and compilation in the same task.

The extracted strings will be stored at `po/untranslated.po`. You can pass this on to the third party for translation. _This file is auto-generated, so do not make any manual changes to it before or after generation._




## Compiling Strings

Again we can use the grunt module to compile our translations. We look for files to compile in `po/translated/*.po`. Put any new translation files in here. You do not need to merge them into one file.

### Running Compilation

You can run a compilation through the grunt task:

`grunt nggettext_compile`

Or if you use our custom task `grunt translate`, it will run extract and compilation in the same task.

After the compilation is complete, the file will be located at `app/translations.js`. It is automatically included in the project, so you don't need to take any further action. _This file is auto-generated, so do not make any manual changes to it before or after generation._
