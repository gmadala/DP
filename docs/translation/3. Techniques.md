# Translation Techniques

There are several different situations we commonly come across when translating strings. Here is a list of them and our proposed solution for it.



## Strings

Majority of your translations will be simple strings.

In __JS__, you can use the following code:

```js
gettextCatalog.getString('Username');
```

In __HTML__, you can use the translate directive:

```html
<p translate>Username</p>
```

Or the filter:

```html
{{ errors.invalidName | translate }}
```

In some cases you may have some more complicated HTML. Here are some additional samples for those cases:

__Label Names__

Some labels only need their text translated and nothing more. In these cases we don't need to translate the whole string, just the text:

```html
<p class="caps vin"><span translate>VIN</span>: {{ payment.vin }}</p>
```

This usually applies to VINs, STKs, other numbers or counts (checkout count). These are basic formatting and not specifically translatable.

__Boolean Switchers__

We previously used an easier way to write the two strings, but that now causes extraction problems. Please use this new method instead.

```html
<!-- OLD -->
<div class="span8 static" translate>{{ { true: 'Enabled', false: 'Disabled' }[enabled] }}</div>

<!-- NEW -->
<div class="span8 static">
  <span ng-show="enabled" translate>Enabled</span>
  <span ng-show="!enabled" translate>Disabled</span>
</div>
```

__Passing Strings to Directives__

This will require you to use the filter method when passing through attributes.

```html
<div class="chart-obj"
    nxg-chart
    nxg-chart-type="line"
    nxg-chart-data-name="{{ 'Days to Turn' | translate }}"
    nxg-chart-description-x="{{ 'Average # of Days to Turn' | translate }}"
    nxg-chart-data="analytics.averageTurn.data"
    nxg-chart-labels="true">
</div>
```

__Strings with Icons__

Since icons don't need to be translated, don't include them in the translation string.

```html
<!-- BAD -->
<th class="sortable" translate>
  Description <span class="sortArrows"></span>
</th>

<!-- GOOD -->
<th class="sortable">
  <span translate>Description</span> <span class="sortArrows"></span>
</th>
```

__String Concatenation__

In cases where you need to concatenate strings in __JS__, use the __Context__ method in the section below.



## Plurals

In __HTML__, you can use the following code:

```html
<p translate translate-n="total.length" translate-plural="Items">Item</p>
```

`translate-n` is the count of items. _1_ will give singular, _2_ or more will give plural.
`translate-plural` is the plural string form. Inside of the element is the singular form.

_NOTE:_ Currently, there is no way to properly use plurals with the filter.

In __JS__, you can use the following code:

```js
gettextCatalog.getPlural(count, 'Bird', 'Birds');
```


## Context

In the __JS__ methods you can pass a context which is helpful when you are using complex dynamic values. For example, instead of:

```js
gettextCatalog.getString('This plan is ' + (isEnabled) ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled');
```

which the extractor won't pick up correctly, you could use this:

```js
gettextCatalog.getString('This plan is {{ status }}', {
    status: (isEnabled) ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled'
});
```

which allows the extractor to correctly pull the string, and keep your code cleaner.

Contexts are also available on the plural method:

```js
gettextCatalog.getPlural(count, '{{ total }} Item', '{{ total }} Items', {
    total: items.getActiveItems()
});
```

Unfortunately, contexts are not capable in the __HTML__ code in any way.



## Comments

Translation files can have comments or notes attached to each translation row. We can pass these directly from the code.

In __JS__ you can use triple slash comments:

```js
/// {{ paymentType }} can be "payment" or "fee"
gettextCatalog.getString('Your {{ paymentType }} has been received', {
    paymentType: payment.isFee ? 'payment' : 'fee'
});
```

In __HTML__ you can only do it on the directives:

```html
<p translate translate-comment="Used in a Verb context">File</p>
```
