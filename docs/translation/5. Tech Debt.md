# Tech Debt

This file simply contains some information about the files we modified in order for translation to work correctly on our current code base.

## angular-gettext

We've had to modify angular-gettext framework itself since it included the `$animate` option of AngularJS. We are running an old version which does not support `$animate`. To fix, we made the following changes to `app/private-components/angular-gettext/dist/angular-gettext.js`:

- Updated the `prefixDebug` function to allow for easier viewing of untranslated strings
- Removed `$animate` dependency on lines 139-140, changed to appending / remove instead


## FullCalendar

We've hacked the FullCalendar code to allow translations for dates. It's been moved to the `app/private-components` folder while we have the modified copy, but can be moved back once upgraded to 2.0+ with localization support.

At the moment we use MomentJS date translations to load into FullCalendar. Here is the code we've added for reference:

    // # HACK
    //   Language fix for pre-2.0
    var langTranslations = moment().lang();
    var langOptions = {
      monthNames: langTranslations._months,
      monthNamesShort: langTranslations._monthsShort,
      dayNames: langTranslations._weekdays,
      dayNamesShort: langTranslations._weekdaysShort
    };
