# Translation Introduction

In order to allow our non-native English speaking users to have the best experience, we translate the app into several other languages.

When creating new features or changing code, we need to be aware of any strings that will need translation.



## Framework

We use [angular-gettext](http://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/) for our translations. This library can handle a bulk of the pain points in translating strings. The library will:

- Extract strings from the source with a grunt task
- Compile the strings into a JS file ready for use

If you want to know the full details about it, you can read their short documentation in their [developer guide](http://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/)



## Testing

When in your local environment, we put angular-gettext into debug mode. This will surround any missing strings with two underscores: _\_\_Example String\_\__. If you see text like this, you know that it is missing a translation for your current language.
