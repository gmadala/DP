# Translation Issues

There are some cases with _gotchas_ when translating. If you are having issues, check if your problem is solved below.


## Dynamic Templating Translation

Since we are using templating, we might not be able to pull a specific value for translation. For example, consider:

```
<p translate> {{ item.FloorplanStatusName }} </p>
```

In this case, the extractor will pull out the text as it is, but it will mean nothing to the translators. For this, we won't need them to translate this text, but we still apply it because we know the values will return a specific set of results, therefor getting translated correctly.

In some cases this string might already be translated -- e.g. if it came from the API translated -- so we won't need to translate again.


## HTML in Translation Strings

There will be some cases where HTML will have to be included in the translation string. We try to minimize it as much as possible, but simple formatting may slip in. For example, it's ok to have the following:

```
<p translate>Hello <strong>{{ name }}</strong></p>
```

which the translator will see as `Hello <strong>{{ name }}</strong>`. However, if the HTML does not need to be included, leave it off. For example, in the following case:

```
// Bad
<button translate>Download <span class="icon-download"></span></button>
```

should be using the following code instead:

```
// Good
<button><span translate>Download</span> <span class="icon-download"></span></button>
```

Although it is more verbose, it only translates the string which is what we need. The icon doesn't need to be included. This will also prevent having duplicate translations for the same string -- e.g. "Download" and "Download <span class="icon-download"></span>".
