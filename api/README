This mock data structure mirrors the API document except for the added call response data and the exclusion of the request object specs.

Keep in mind that the API doc is unfinished, and most of this data structure has been copied directly from it's (often erroneous) pages. Fixes will need to be made as API doc is updated.

Layout of data and information:
-------------------------------

Main folders follow API URL structure.
Secondary folders are either a Parameter Name ( ex: {model} ), Example Parameter Data ( ex: honda ), or a __default folder for mock data system.
Files are either JSON take directly from current API responses, manually generated JSON data based on the specs doc, or call descriptions from the specs doc.

Example structure: (Folders are prepended with a dash. Files are prepended with an asterisk.)
- url
  - parameter
    * call description file
    - __default
      * call data
  - specific parameter
    - __default
      * call data


Postman
-------
[Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) helps you be more efficient while working with APIs. Using Postman, you can construct complex HTTP requests quickly, organize them in collections and share them with your co-workers.

We've included a Postman test environment and collections in the `api/postman/` directory. These can be imported into Postman.
